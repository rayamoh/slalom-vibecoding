# Project Brief

## Project Name
**VibeCoding Financial Crime Detection Platform**

## Vision
Build a financial crime detection system for mobile money transactions with a **phased approach**:
- **Phase 1**: Local POC demonstrating ML + rule-based fraud detection with minimal infrastructure
- **Phase 2**: Production-ready end-to-end deployment with authentication, scalability, and cloud infrastructure
- **Phase 3**: Advanced features including network analytics and automation

## Core Problem
Detecting fraudulent mobile money transactions (primarily TRANSFER and CASH-OUT patterns) in high-volume transaction streams while minimizing false positives and providing explainable results suitable for regulated environments.

## Target Users
- **Fraud Analysts/Investigators**: Triage alerts, investigate entities, disposition cases
- **Fraud Operations Leads**: Manage queues, KPIs, coverage, false positives
- **Model Risk/Compliance**: Validate model, monitor drift, approve changes
- **Platform/Data Engineers**: Maintain pipelines, availability, security
- **Product Owners**: Configure policies, thresholds, SLAs, roadmap

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 (Local POC)
1. Batch transaction scoring with ML + rule-based detection
2. Alert generation and basic case management workflow
3. Explainable outputs (SHAP for ML, reason codes for rules)
4. SQLite-based local demo with sample dataset
5. Basic UI for alert review and disposition

### Phase 2 (Production)
1. Real-time transaction scoring with < 100ms latency
2. Authentication and role-based access control
3. PostgreSQL with proper migrations and scaling
4. Docker containerization and CI/CD pipeline
5. Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure)
6. Advanced performance monitoring and alerts

### Phase 3 (Advanced)
1. Network graph analytics
2. Feature store and model registry integration
3. A/B testing framework for models

## Key Constraints
- **Dataset Constraint**: Cannot use balance columns (`oldbalanceOrg`, `newbalanceOrig`, `oldbalanceDest`, `newbalanceDest`) as they become misleading after fraud annulment
- **Phase 1 Constraints**: Local POC only, SQLite database, no authentication, no deployment infrastructure
- **Phase 2 Requirements**: Production-grade security, PostgreSQL, Docker, CI/CD
- **Regulatory**: Must maintain audit trails and explainability (post-Phase 1)
- **Performance Target (Phase 2+)**: Real-time scoring must be < 100ms

## Scope
Phase 1 - Local POC (In-Scope)
- Transaction batch processing and scoring
- ML-based fraud detection (scikit-learn/XGBoost)
- **Rule-based fraud detection (deterministic rules)**
- Combined decision logic (ML + rules)
- Feature engineering (excluding forbidden balance columns)
- Alert generation and queue management
- Basic case management
- Explainability (SHAP for ML, reason codes for rules)
- Entity profile views
- **SQLite database for local demo**
- Simple React UI for investigators
- **No authentication (local demo only)**
- Sample dataset and seed data

### Phase 2 -Local POC)**: Core detection and alerting - 6-8 weeks
- **Phase 2 (Production)**: Authentication, infrastructure, deployment - 6-8 weeks
- **Phase 3 (Advanced)**: Network analytics and automation - Future

<!-- Generated by Copilot -->
- **Docker containerization**
- **CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)**
- **Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure)**
